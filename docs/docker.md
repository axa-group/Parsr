# Docker

## Prepare the Docker service

In your docker installation's configuration, increase the amount of active memory allotted to the instance to 4GB.

## Build Parsr

At the root of the project, launch:

  ```
  docker-compose build
  ```

This will build Parsr, along with its dependencies.

## Run Parsr

In the root of the repository, launch:

  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```

Note: A docker volume will be created at first launch so that the data will be kept at containers restart.
