To configure the pipeline and choose what modules will be called and with what parameters, you have to provide a JSON file.
There is only a few required keys:

- `version` `[Number]` is the version number of the API.
- `extractor` `[Object]` is a bunch of parameters about the extraction.
- `cleaner` `[Array]` is a list of every cleaning tools that will be called.
- `output` `[Object]` contains the list of fromats to export and some other details.

Cleaning tools have default parameters that work pretty well, but you can override the parameters by providing the in the config.

The cleaner array may appear unconventionnal but is really easy to use. Every item can be of type:

- `String`: it's the name of the cleaning tool you want to call.
- `Object`: it's the parameters for the cleaning tool below.

## 1. Structure

```js
{
    "version": 0.5,               // Version number of the configuration file format
    "extractor": {                // Extraction options (See section 2.)
        "pdf": "extractor-tool",  // Select the tool to extract PDF files
        "img": "extractor-tool",  // Select the tool to extract image files (JPG, PNG, TIFF, etc.)
        "language": "lang"        // Select the defaut language of your document. This is used to increase the accuracy of OCR tools (See section 2.2)
    },
    // The cleaner pipeline consists of a list of modules that will run on given file (See section 3.)
    "cleaner": [
        // The first module to run on the document and send the result to the next module
        "module-name-1",
        // The second module to run. This syntax is also accepted. It will use only the default module options
        [
            "module-name-2"
        ],
        // The thrid module to run with some special options
        [
            "module-name-3",
            { "option-1": { value: 50, min: 0, max: 100 }, "option-2": { value: true } }
        ],
    ],
    // Output options (See section 4.)
    "output": {
        "formats": {                       // list of format that will be outputed (See section 4.1.)
            "json": true,
            "text": false,
            "csv": true,
            "markdown": false
        },
        "granularity": "word | character", // Set the granularity of the output (See section 4.2.)
        "includeMarginals": false          // Chose whether the output will include headers and footers (See section 4.3.)
    }
}
```

_This means the module called `fontMerge` will be called, then `removeOutOfPage`, then `removeWhitespace` with some special parameters, etc._

## 2. Extractor Config

### 2.1. Extractor Tools

Different extractors are available for each input file format.

- PDF files: three extractors are currently available for PDF files: `pdfminer`, which is an advanced python based extractor capable of extracting low and high level textual structures (from characters to paragraphs) and `abbyy` that rely on ABBYY Finereader that is paid software. It is also possible to use `tesseract` in this case. The document will then be converted as an image, so expect the accuracy to be lower on texts.
- Images: two extractors are supporter for images: `tesseract` which is an Open Source OCR and `abbyy` that rely on ABBYY Finereader that is paid software.

### 2.2. Language

The language parameter is an option that will be pass to Tesseract when using it. It must be in the [Tesseract language format](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/doc/tesseract.1.asc#languages), which is an equivalent of [ISO 639-2/T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

## 3. Cleaner Config

The pipeline is defined by every module names and their options. Modules will then be run one by one in the same order as in the configuration.

Module can be called in the full form:

```json
[
	"module",
	{
		"option-1": 100,
		"option-2": true
	}
],
```

Or just with there default options:

```json
[
	"module"
],
```

Or just with there default options in the condensed format:

```json
"module",
```

_Note: some modules have dependencies that need to be called before in the pipeline._

## 4. Output Config

### 4.1. Output Format

The platform can export the following formats:

- `json`
- `markdown`
- `text`
- `csv`
- `pdf` (pandoc required)

### 4.2. Granularity

The `granularity` parameter can be either `word` or `character` and defines at what level of granularity the export will be.

_Warning: exporting with a character granularity will result on very big Json files (probably more than 10Mo)._

### 4.3. Include Marginals

The `includeMarginals: boolean` parameter allows to chose whether the output will include headers and footers.
