"While most designers might not intentionally divulge confidential","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"Another possible scenario is that your firm might suffer a data","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"in the most difficult position of having to prove that the owner’s","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"What’s “confidential”?","True","True","True","False","heading"
"The problem with many, if not most, of these owner-written NDAs","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"Rather than precisely limit the information the owner wants to","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"policies…and other similar information.","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"At least this NDA sets forth a definition of what is to be deemed","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"confidential—most NDAs don’t. But note the use of “other","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"expansive definition of “confidential information.”","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"“Owners deliberately want a very broad definition to include","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"information not even contemplated at the early phase of the","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"It’s up to you to revise the agreement to define confidential","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"According to Rigassio, “Owners don’t want the burden of having","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"the A/E to concede, ‘Yes, our actions have caused you irreparable","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
