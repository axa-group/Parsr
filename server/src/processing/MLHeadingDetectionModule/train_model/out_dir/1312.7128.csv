"leave traceable Internet content.","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"Facebook (facebook.com), Google Plus (plus.google.com), or Twitter (twitter.com).","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"To make our search for such content manageable, a small number of search terms were sought that","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"could conceivably give a relatively clear signal of prescient information in an automated query of a large","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"database. The time period of our search was from 2006 January to 2013 September. Search terms were","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"chosen to optimize three major attributes. First, search terms were sought that described an item or event","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"that acquired a name during the time period of our search. Such terms would allow two different epochs","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"to be compared -- potentially prescient content before this information became available, and normal","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"content afterwards. For example, mentions of the ""War of the Roses"" occurred numerous times, but none","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"that could easily be tagged in an automated search as even potentially prescient, since the actual Wars of","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"the Roses ended in 1485, and the name ""Wars of the Roses"" only came into common usage in the 1800s,","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"well before our automated searches began [19]. Therefore all discussions in our search period could be","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"attributed to normal discussions of historic events.","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"Second, search terms should involve as unique a label as possible. Were a large automated search","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"focused on a common term, it would be difficult to automatically differentiate a prescient mention of this","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"term from likely much more numerous common mentions. For example ""Comet McNaught"" was not","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"considered to be a good search term because its discoverer, Robert H. McNaught, has discovered over 50","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"comets dating as far back as 1987. Therefore, an automated search returning mentions of ""Comet","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"McNaught"" in 2006, for example, could arguably not be returning prescient mentions of the impressively","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"bright Comet McNaught in 2009, but rather mentions of one of the earlier-discovered comets that bears","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"the same popular name.","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"did not go by the popular name of Comet ISON. Therefore, the term ""Comet ISON"" is a unique label that","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"should not be easily confused with something else. Comet ISON is internationally known and has been a","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"topic of popular discussion on the Internet since its discovery. Histories of bright comets like Comet","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"ISON are generally well kept by societies and journals around the world, indicating that Comet ISON","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"might remain memorable well into the future. Conversely, there is little reason for anyone without","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"prescient information to be referring to something as ""Comet ISON"" before 2012 September. Therefore,","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"discussions or even mentions of ""Comet ISON"" before 2012 September were searched for as potentially","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"prescient evidence of time travelers from the future.","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"On 2013 March 16, the newly elected pope of the Catholic Church, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, chose the","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"official name of Francis. Bergoglio is the first pope ever to choose the name Francis. Therefore, the term","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"""Pope Francis"" is relatively unique and came into the public lexicon during our search period. Since","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"Christianity is currently the most popular religion on Earth, Roman Catholics comprise the largest sect of","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"Christianity [20], and papal histories are well recorded, it seems reasonable to assume that ""Pope Francis""","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"would remain memorable well into the future. Before 2013 March, however, there is little reason for","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"anyone without prescient information to mention a ""Pope Francis"". Discussions or even mentions on the","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"hashtags make information easier to find in online searches. We therefore typically included the","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"content involving Comet ISON on the Internet, they might include the hashtag ""#cometison"". Since that","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"hashtagged term would not occur in colloquial text, it acts as a label that can be found in a search by","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"At the time of this writing, the most popular search engine is Google. Unfortunately, searching for","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"prescient web content using the publicly available Google search has proven unreliable. Although","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"providing the ability to sort identified content by date, several exploratory tests on Google found an","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"initially surprising number of web pages that contained seemingly prescient information. Upon further","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"inspection, however, all potentially-prescient content on those web pages was clearly non-prescient. One","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"prominent reason for this was the appearance of recent advertisements on older news stories. Bing","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"(bing.com), another currently popular search engine, did not appear to have a sufficient ability to filter","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"Another place potentially prescient content might be found is on posts to the social network Facebook.","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"Additionally, Facebook also allows backdated posts, as far back as the day the Facebook account was","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"methods to search for time travelers.","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"Technically, what was searched for here was not physical time travelers themselves, but rather","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"informational traces left by them. Although such information might be left by physical time travelers,","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"conceivably only information itself could be sent back in time, which would be a type of time travel that","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"Similarly, instantaneous time travel to the same place on Earth might violate conservation of momentum,","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"as the motion of the Earth around the Sun (etc.) might delegate a significant change in momentum for a","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"Although the negative results reported here may indicate that time travelers from the future are not","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"among us and cannot communicate with us over the modern day Internet, they are by no means proof.","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"There are many reasons for this. First, it may be physically impossible for time travelers to leave any","False","False","True","False","paragraph"

"time travelers may not want to be found, and may be good at covering their tracks. Additionally, time","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"travelers just may not have left the specific event tags that we were searching for. Finally, our searches","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
"were not comprehensive, so that even if time travelers left the exact event tags searched for here, we","False","False","True","False","paragraph"
