# What is a One-Pager?

*“How do I know what I think until I see what I say?”*

*-- E.M. Forster*

*“Only connect.” –E.M. Forster*

1. A one pager is a single-page response to your reading. It is a way of making your pattern of your unique understanding. It is a way to be creative and experimental. It is a way to respond imaginatively and honestly. It is a way to be brief and compressed.
2. The **purpose** of a one-pager is to own what you are reading. We learn best when we can create our own patterns.
3. A one-pager connects the verbal and the visual; it connects the ideas in what you read to your thoughts. It connects words and images. The one- pager becomes a metaphor for the reading you have done.
4. When you do a one-pager, **do** ***any*** **or** ***all*** of these:  
   1. Pull out a quotation or two, using them to explore one of your own ideas, and write them on the page (perhaps using a different colored pen).  
   2. Use visual images, either drawn or cut from magazines, to create a visual focus.  
   3. Cluster around a dominant impression, feeling or thought you have while reading.  
   4. Make a personal statement about what you have read.  
   5. Ask a question or two and answer it (them).  
   6. Create the one-pager so that your audience will understand something about the reading from what you do.  
   7. Feel free to use colored pens or pencils.
5. What not to do:  
   1. Don’t merely summarize.  
   2. Don’t be restricted by the lines on the paper. Use unlined paper. c. Don’t think a half a page will do—make it rich with quotes and images.
6. Grading: full credit depends on completeness (and imagination counts, too.)
