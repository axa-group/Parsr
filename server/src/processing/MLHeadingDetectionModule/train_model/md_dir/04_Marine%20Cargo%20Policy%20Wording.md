or Claims Settling agent shown on the policy or Certificate of Insurance.

This notice must include  
(a) the location of the consignment  
(b) contact names and numbers  
(c) a brief description of the extent of loss and/or damage

A decision will then be made whether to appoint a surveyor or investigator.  
Advice will be given regarding what action should be taken next to pursue the claim.

### (3) Immediate notification must be given to carriers and bailees by telephone or fax

This will allow them the opportunity to inspect the damage or commence tracer action for missing or short delivered goods.

In the event of non-delivery notice must be given as soon as it becomes apparent that the goods have not been received when expected.

### (4) Write to carriers and other bailees within 3 Days of delivery holding them responsible for the loss and/ or damage

The time limits for providing notice of claim vary between the different Conditions of Carriage or Bailment but timescales are generally very short and failure to provide notification of claim within these timescales will enable carriers and bailees to repudiate valid claims.

**It is Your duty and Your agents’ to take steps to protect and preserve the rights and remedies available to Us.**

These are the rights under subrogation which enable insurers to stand in place of the insured once the insurance claim has been paid and recover from the parties responsible for the loss an amount up to but not exceeding the amount of the claim settlement

### (5) Formal claim against Carriers and Bailees

When the extent of the loss and/or damage has been quantified a costed claim must be submitted to the responsible party together with supporting documentation.

If there are likely to be delays in quantifying the claim, estimates must be submitted within a reasonable time and an acknowledgement of receipt sought.

**Note – As with initial notification of claim the formal claim must be submitted to carriers and/or bailees within the timescales laid down in the Conditions of Carriage or Bailment (usually 9 and 12 months) in order to prevent valid claims being declined.**
