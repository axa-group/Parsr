Nothing in the Agreements removes or limits Spotify’s liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury caused by its negligence, and, if required by law, gross negligence. Some aspects of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions if prohibited by law.

## 16. Third Party Rights

No Third Party Beneficiaries. Other than as set out in this section, the Agreements are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and Spotify, and in no event shall the Agreements create any third party beneficiary rights. Furthermore, the rights to terminate, rescind, or agree to any variation, waiver, or settlement of the Agreements are not subject to the consent of any other person.

Podcast Hosting Services. If you host your Authorized User Content with a third party podcast hosting service **(“Podcast Hosting Service”),** you acknowledge that this Agreement is between you and Spotify only, not with your Podcast Hosting Service. Your Podcast Hosting Service is not an intended beneficiary of the Agreements and your Podcast Hosting Service is not responsible for the Service and the Content thereof. Your Podcast Hosting Service has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Spotify, in its sole discretion, may share Content with Podcast Hosting Services, such as data analytics, and such Content may include data related to your Authorized User Content.

## 17. Entire Agreement

Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral. Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Spotify for Podcasters Service may be governed by additional agreements. When you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms. Some of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website. To the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Spotify for Podcasters Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.

## 18. Severability and Waiver

---

Severability. Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements shall be held unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the Agreements and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Waiver. A provision of the Agreements may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. No failure or delay on the part of Spotify in the exercise of any power or right under the Agreements shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right or power under the Agreements shall operate as a waiver of such right or of any other right or power. The waiver by Spotify of a breach of any provision of the Agreements shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach of the Agreements.

## 19. Assignment

Spotify may assign the Agreements or any part of them, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements. You may not assign the Agreements or any part of them, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.

## 20. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Spotify and its officers, directors, employees and representatives harmless from and against any and all liabilities, damages, awards, settlements, losses, claims and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees and costs of investigation) due to or arising from (i) your use of the Service and all activity under your Account, (ii) your violation of any term of these Spotify for Podcasters Terms, (iii) any claim by a third party of infringement of any third party right, including but not limited to any copyright or other intellectual property right, property right or privacy right, by you, your Account, your Authorized User Content and/or Spotify’s use of the Authorized User Content in accordance with the terms of these Spotify for Podcasters Terms; or (iv) any claim that the Authorized User Content has caused any damage to a third party (including but not limited to claims that the Authorized User Content has caused damage to any personal rights).

## 21. Choice of Law, Mandatory Arbitration and Venue 21.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction

The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising out of or in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 21.2.1. Spotify does not accept any codes of conduct as mandatory in connection with the services provided under these Spotify for Podcasters Terms.

# 21.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

This arbitration agreement applies only to users in the United States.

---

## 21.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration

You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.

## 21.2.2 Exceptions

Notwithstanding clause 22.2.1 above, you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court, (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable U.S. federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, or (3) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.

## 21.2.3 No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver

YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

## 21.2.4 Arbitration rules

Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force **(“AAA Rules”),** as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Spotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.

Any arbitration hearings will take place in New York, NY, or at a location mutually agreed upon by the parties, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.

---

Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the relevant AAA rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

## 21.2.5 Time for filing

Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.

## 21.2.6 Notice; Process

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, or Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Spotify's address for Notice is: Spotify, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought **("Demand").** We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Spotify shall pay you the greater of (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.

## 21.2.7 Enforceability

If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement (Section 21.2) is found to be unenforceable in court or in arbitration, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement (Section 21.2) shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 21.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreements.
