During the ﬁnancial year, Bega Cheese Group paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring the Directors and all executive ofﬁcers of the Group and of any related body corporate against a liability incurred as such a Director or executive ofﬁcer, not exceeding the extent permitted by law. The contracts of insurance prohibit disclosure of the nature of the liabilities and the amount of the premiums. The Group has not otherwise, during or since the ﬁnancial year, except to the extent permitted by law, indemniﬁed or agreed to indemnify an ofﬁcer of the Group or any related body corporate against a liability incurred as such an ofﬁcer. This does not include remuneration or employment related beneﬁts, any sum payable pursuant to a ﬁnancial support direction or contribution notice issued in respect of any pension scheme, ﬁnes and pecuniary penalties for a deliberate or intentional act, nor amounts which are prohibited to be paid by law.

Each Director has entered into a deed of access and indemnity with the Group which indemniﬁes them for losses incurred as a Director or ofﬁcer of Bega Cheese and places an obligation on Bega Cheese Group to maintain a current Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ policy with a reputable insurer for the period of the Director’s tenure and for a seven year tail period (or longer if there is an unresolved outstanding claim against the Director) and a contractual right of the Director to access Group records for the period of the Director’s tenure and for a seven year tail period (or longer if there is an unresolved outstanding claim against the Director).

The Company has also agreed to indemnify the Company Secretaries and certain senior executives for all liabilities to another person (other than the Company or a related body corporate) that may arise from their position, except where the liability arises out of conduct involving a lack of good faith. The agreement stipulates that the Company will meet the full amount of any such liabilities, including costs and expenses.
