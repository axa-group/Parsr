# USMLE STEP 1 TEST QUESTION FORMATS

## Single-Item Questions

A single patient-centered vignette is associated with one question followed by four or more response options. The response options are lettered (A, B, C, D, E). A portion of the questions require interpretation of graphic or pictorial materials. You are required to select the best answer to the question. Other options may be partially correct, but there is only ONE BEST answer. This is the traditional, most frequently used multiple- choice question format on the examination.

## Strategies for Answering Single One-Best-Answer Test Questions

The following are strategies for answering one-best-answer items:

- Read each patient vignette and question carefully. It is important to understand what is being asked.
- Try to generate an answer and then look for it in the response option list.
- Alternatively, read each response option carefully, eliminating those that are clearly incorrect.
- Of the remaining options, select the one that is most correct.
- If unsure about an answer, it is better to guess since unanswered questions are automatically counted as wrong answers.
