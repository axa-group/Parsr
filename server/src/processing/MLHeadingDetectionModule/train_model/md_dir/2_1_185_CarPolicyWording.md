of the other driver involved and details of any independent witnesses if possible.

TS17 6EN  
We can only deal with you in respect of cancellation – we are unable to cancel the policy on the authority of anyone else even if you have given authority for them to act for you.

If you have not paid us sufficient money for us to retain premium, or if you have not paid the full annual premium but have had an accident or claim or committed fraud or made a false declaration, then we reserve the right to recover the money that you owe and apply our £52.50 cancellation fee.

We may cancel your policy:  
a) in the event of deliberate or reckless misrepresentation (see General condition 1).  
b) if we are unable to continue cover due to changes to your policy (see General condition 2).  
c) in the event of fraudulent claims (see General condition 7).  
d) if you are unable to provide the appropriate proof of NCD (see General condition 9).  
e) if you do not pay your premium (see General condition 11).  
Cancelling your policy means you will not be covered from the date and time of cancellation.

#### 13. Cancelling optional covers  

(Sections I, J, K or L)  
You have the right to cancel optional Sections I,  
J, K or L of your policy back to the original start  
date. If you decide to cancel any optional section of your policy in this way, it must be done within the  
14 day cooling off period. The 14 day cooling off period commences when the policy is purchased or received by you. Cancelling your policy in this way will mean that you will not have been covered by us. If your policy is cancelled back to the start date, we will return the premium paid, provided that no claims or accidents have occurred.  
If you cancel sections I, J, K or L after 14 days of the start date we will not refund the premium for this cover.

#### 14. Automatic renewal  

By purchasing this policy you have provided consent to set up a continuous payment authority. This means we are authorised to

automatically renew your policy and apply for renewal payments from your account every year, even if your card has expired, until you instruct us to stop.

We will contact you by email at least 21 days before the end of your period of insurance. If you still meet our eligibility criteria, we will seek to automatically renew your policy by using the latest details you provided to us. You will also be provided with a renewal invitation which you should check via My AXA Account to ensure all your details  
are still correct and relevant. If any changes are required or you do not wish to renew your policy you should let us know via My AXA Account before your renewal date.

Please note that if you pay annually by Switch or Maestro we will not be able to automatically renew your policy. If you no longer meet our eligibility criteria, we will not be able to renew your policy. In all cases we will contact you prior to your renewal date to advise you what to do next.  
How to opt-out  
Email us after you have purchased the policy at [help@AXAinsurance.com](mailto:help@AXAinsurance.com) or call us  
on 0330 024 1158

#### 15. Fees  
We are an online company and all your documentation will be available via My AXA Account. We reserve the right to charge an administration fee of £10 for any change or correction to your policy that we make on your behalf.

If you cancel outside the 14 day cooling off period the cancellation fee will be £52.50.

If we cancel your policy the cancellation fee will be £52.50.

If you have paid your premium using a credit card a 2% charge applies which is not refundable if you cancel your policy.
