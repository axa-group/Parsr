### Connections & Explanations

***Receiver Connecting Wire:*** The *SXX-SS V2* is equipped with an LRP Multicon receiver wire. As supplied, it will easily fit in all ordinary receivers. Make sure you connect it to receiver with correct polarity and use channel 2.

***Sensor Connector:*** The bi-directional multipole sensor wire connects the speed-control and the motor. Always use the sensor wire and do not alter or modify this cable! There are replaceable/optional hall sensor wires available.  
Through this sensor connector, the *SXX-SS V2* can also be updated with the latest software updates using the optional „USB Bridge \#81800“. Please refer to chapter „USB Soft- ware Updateability“ for details

***Power Wires:*** For maximum performance, flexible silicone power wires without any connectors are used. The unique splitted solder-tabs allow easy and convenient replacement of the power wires. Nevertheless some soldering skills are required. Avoid soldering longer then 5sec per joint to avo- id possible damage due to overheating of the components! There are replacement power wires available, please refer to complete line-up at www.LRP.cc.

***Heatsink:*** To achieve best perfomance even under extreme conditions, the heatsink has been directly mounted to the speed-control. This ensures the best possible heat transfer away from the speed-control.

***Caution:*** Never attempt to remove the heatsink or your *SXX- SS V2* may get damaged! The heatsink is an integral part, glued to the fet‘s and therefore cannot be removed.

***Optional plugged fan:*** for stock racing a fan is not required as the speed-control doesn‘t become very warm, but if you wish to add the optional fan (\#82512) it can be mounted on top of the heatsink and then it get‘s plugged into the 3-pin connector on the front.

### Installation Guide

- Position the speed-control and capacitor where they are protected in the event of a crash and gives you easy access to the connectors and buttons.
- Mount the speedo and capacitor using the supplied thick/black doubled-sided tape
- Make sure there is enough clearance between the speed-control, power-wires, antenna and receiver. Avoid any direct contact between power components, the receiver or the antenna as this can cause interference. If interference occurs, position the components at a different place in the model.
- The aerial should be run vertically up and away from the receiver. Avoid contact with any parts made of carbon fibre or metal. If the aerial is too long, don’t coil up the excess length. See also the instructions supplied with your radio control system.

The *SXX-SS V2* comes supplied with flexible 3.3mm² silicone power-wires without connectors. Be very careful with the correct wire sequence/colors since an incorrect connection may damage the speed-control! Avoid crea- ting solder bridges on the solder-tabs and isolate all connections carefully.

- Connect the speed-control to the receiver (position: Channel 2
- Blue power-wire ? Speedo MOT.A to motor „A“
- Yellow power-wire ? Speedo MOT.B to motor „B“
- Orange power-wire ? Speedo MOT.C to motor „C“
- Connect the hall sensor cable to the speed-control (underneath the solder-tabs) and the motor.
- Doublecheck all connections before connecting the speed-control to a battery.  
***Caution:*** If battery is connected with reversed polarity it will destroy your speed-control!
- Red power-wire ? Speedo BAT+ to battery „Plus“
- Black power-wire ? Speedo BAT- to battery „Minus“
- The speed-control is now ready to be set-up.

### USB Software Updateability

Through the sensor connector the *SXX-SS V2* can be updated to the latest firmware available for download at www.LRP.cc.  
The optional „USB Bridge - Speedo Firmware Update + PC-Link“ (\#81800) and a PC are required to do so, please refer to LRP website and the manual which comes with the interface for exact details how to do software updates to your speed-control.  
The same USB-Bridge can be used to update all the latest LRP speed-controls (80905, 80955, 80880, etc). Please check guide at ww.LRP.cc for further details.

### Calibrate Speed-Control to Radio

In setup mode the speed-control stores every step (e.g. learning your radios neutral and endpoints) by pressing the SET button. All the settings will be stored in the memory even if it will be disconnected from the battery.

***TRANSMITTER SETTINGS:*** Setup the following basic functions on your transmitter (if available):  
Throttle Travel High ATV, EPA 100%  
Brake Travel Low ATV, EPA, ATL 100%  
Throttle Exponential EXP, EXPO start with 0  
Neutral Trim SUB Trim centre  
Servo Reverse Throttle Reverse any setting, don‘t change after set-up procedure!  
If your transmitter doesn‘t offer any of above functions, it‘s already in „basic setup“ mode.

- Ensure that the speed-control is not connected to the drive battery and is switched off.
- Remove motor pinion or ensure that the wheels of the model are free to rotate.
- Switch the transmitter on and set the transmitter throttle stick to neutral.

- Connect the speed-control to the battery and switch the unit on.
- Hold the SET button pressed for at least 3sec.
- You entered setup mode and the SET LED flashes blue (it will flash until the setup is completed).

- Leave transmitter in neutral position and press the SET button once.
- Neutral setting is stored , MODE LED flashes yellow and the motor beeps.
- Hold full throttle on transmitter and press the SET button once.
- Full-throttle setting is stored, MODE LED flashes red.
- Hold full brake on transmitter and press the SET button once.
- Brake setting is stored, LED‘s glow red (MODE) and blue (SET).

- This completes the setup procedure and your *SXX-SS V2* is ready to use.
- If you make a mistake during the setup procedure, don‘t worry: Disconnect the battery for about 10sec and start again from the first step.
- At the start of each run switch on the transmitter first, then switch on the car.
- At the end of each run switch of the car, and then switch off the transmitter.
- For storage of the car, disconnect the drive battery at any time!

Check the LED‘s when moving the throttle on your radio to doublecheck everything is setup correctly.

| Function | Status | Mode LED | Set LED |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| Neutral | -- | off | blue |
| Neutral (when „Boost Zero“ enabled) | -- |^| flashes blue |
| Forward | partial throttle | yellow | off |
|^| full throttle |^| blue |
| Brake | partial brake | red | off |
|^| full throttle |^| blue |

### Multi Protection System 3

New and improved protection system „MPS3“ which also informs you the cause of the shutdown with a special LED flashing sequence. You can indicate that a shutdown occured when blue SET LED flashes very fast and the „error code“ (= cause for shutdown) is indicated by the MODE LED‘s as explained in table below.

***Error Code LED flashing sequences:***

| Error Code | Mode LED's | Set LED | Reason | Possible Cause |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| \#1 | Yellow | Blue (fast flashing) | Speed-Control Thermal Shutdown | 1\. too high settings for ADPC DualMOD power-profiles?  2\. too high gear ratio?  3\. too low motor wind for application?  4\. too high mechanical motor timing | 
| \#2 | Red |^| Motor Thermal Shutdown |^|
| \#3 | Yellow/Red (alternate) |^| Battery Low Voltage Cut-Off | 1\. battery empty or wrong setting in ACS2? 2\. battery damaged? 3\. motor too strong for battery discharge capability? 4\. poor connection (bad connector, bad soldering joint)? |
| \#4 | Yellow/Red (same time) |^| Motor Failure | 1\. sensor wire missing or defective? 2\. drivetrain stuck? 3\.motor defective (locked rotor, damaged sensor)? |

***Active power reduction at critical temperatures:*** The cut-off function for both motor- and speed-control temperature is now an active type, in case you‘re getting near critical temperatures the speed-control will auto- matically switch to „Boost0“ mode during operation. A critical temperature is considered as equal to 9 flashes!

This function allows you to finish your run or at least reach the pitlane during running, at reduced speed, as other- weise you would not finish your run!

The blue LED will flash, in case the 9 flashes where reached during the run (to indicate it switched to „Boost0 mode“), but this mode will of course not be stored in the memory but your choosen profiles will be active for next run (after switching off/on) again.

You should not exceed 8 flashes during normal use for both motor- and speed-control temperature, please adjust your ADPCmax.2 profiles and motor accordingly, so you stay within these safe limits. The final thermal cut-off will occur at 10 flashes, as explained further down.

***At your own risk:*** if you wish to disable motor temperature cut-off completely you can do so by using value 0 in Mode.1. We call this function „Hardcore Racing Mode“. as it also disables the cell-voltage cut-off completely.

***Important:*** The speed-controls thermal cut-off can not be disabled!

***Internal-Temp-Check System 3:*** allows you to read-out the maximum internal temperature that the speedo and motor have reached during the run. You can convienently read-out the temperature back in the pits since it remains stored until you turn it on the next time regularly (which will reset the memory). This feature allows you to accurately check if all is running well or if you‘re close to shutdown already.

***How to read-out the temperature:***

- switch at „OFF“ position.
- keep MODE button pressed while you turn switch to „ON“ (then release button).
- at first speed-control temperature will be indicated.
- SET LED will start to flash blue (MODE LED‘s are off) ....
- count the number of flashes.The higher the number, the hotter the speedo ran (shutdown occurs at 10 flashes).
- to change to motor temperature read-out, press MODE button one more time.
- SET LED will start to flash blue (MODE LED‘s are off) again, for motor the LED‘s on time will be shorter.
- count the number of flashes.The higher the number, the hotter the motor ran (shutdown occurs at 10 flashes).
- every flash below 10 equals to 5°C temperature decrease.

***Temperature chart (speed-control and motor temperature):***

| #1 | #2 | #3 | #4 | #5 | #6 | #7 | #8 | #9 | #10 |  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  
|> -45°C > -81°F | -40°C -72°F | -35°C -63°F | -30°C -54°F | -25°C -45°F | -20°C -36°F | -15°C -27°F | -10°C -18°F | -5°C -9°F | Shut- down |  

***Caution:*** motor temperature read-out only works if motor has a built-in NTC temperature sensor!
