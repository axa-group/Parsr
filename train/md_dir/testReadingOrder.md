# AXA AND THE SHARING ECONOMY

## Insight

**The sharing economy helps people save money and earn extra income**, so it is unsurprisingly attracting more and more consumers. In today’s gloomy environment, this new economic model, which is redrawing the boundaries between ownership and use, is here to stay. Global revenue generated by the sharing economy is expected to increase from €15 billion in 2013 to almost €335 billion in 2025.\*

## Challenge

**Insurance is a structural component of the large-scale sharing economy.** Once a community grows beyond a certain point, it has to find an external system to foster trust. Companies in the sector are therefore looking for effective, tailored insurance solutions.

## Strategy

**AXA aims to become the leading insurer of the sharing economy.** This goal involves a strategy of developing ambitious, stimulating partnerships for the Group. With BlaBlaCar, AXA offers the world leader in ridesharing an insurance solution. After just a few months, it is already available in five countries and insured almost 4 million shared rides in 2015. In early 2016, AXA also became the insurer of OuiCar in France and SocialCar in Spain.
