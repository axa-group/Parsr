# Group Operations Information Security Best Practices

When creating a document, **classify** it by selecting the right classification level * _(Public, Internal, Confidential, Secret)_ and determine the list of recipients.

When **printing** Internal or Confidential documents, stay beside the printer to avoid them being disclosed.

Store **confidential** documents in a closed locker or cupboard. Store **secret** data in a **safe.**

Use a **confidentiality screen filter** when displaying restricted, or confidential information on a laptop outside of the office.

Apply the **clean desk policy** and don’t leave “Internal, Confidential, Secret” documents unattended on the desk when you leave the office.

Use shared drives carefully: **Restrict access rights** for specific user access and **encrypt** (with 7zip or Winzip or O365) confidential or secret data. Save files in the appropriate folders.

Don’t send confidential information via email in clear text, **Encrypt** (with 7zip or Winzip or O365) it in a document attached to the email. Don’t send an encrypted document and its password in the same e-mail.

Don’t send professional AXA data to personal or mailboxes. Always check the **list of recipients** to ensure only authorized people may gain access to the information.

Use the corporate AXA secure file transfer **service:** ONE DRIVE or SharePoint. Never use alternative information sharing services, **not approved** by Group Operations, such as dropbox, wetransfer, livebox…

Do not expose any details of your job and missions at AXA on social media.  
Refrain from publishing classified non-public business information on the internet

Always transfer suspicious emails to the security team. Avoid in opening files as attachments whose origin is not safe. Beware of phishing emails.

Do NOT use **non-corporate applications** to store confidential or secret data on corporate mobile devices. Immediately notify your security department in case of **device loss or theft.**

Always use **shredders** or **secured containers** to destroy internal, confidential or secret documents (paper, removable media, …).

In case of doubt or suspicion of information loss, leakage or theft, immediately contact security team.

Avoid putting **sensitive information**/data **in email objects or file/folder names:** To ensure only authorized people may gain access to the information.

### *Four classification levels available:

**Secret**

Any information the disclosure of which could **_seriously damage the essential interests_** of AXA

**Confidential**

Any information which may be communicated only to the persons directly concerned (and clearly defined) and the unwanted disclosure of which could **_significantly harm an AXA project, activity or entity_**

**Internal**

Any information which may circulate only within AXA and may be distributed only on **_a need- to-know basis_**

**Public**

Any information which may be usually publicly accessible and the disclosure of which does not harm the interests of AXA
