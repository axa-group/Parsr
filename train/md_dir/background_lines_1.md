The Red Ribbon Express (RRE) is the world’s largest mass mobilisation drive on HIV/AIDS. The train will travel through 22 states, during its one year long journey, halting at 152 stations. Through the RRE, NACO, intends to break the silence surrounding the issue of HIV/AIDS, by taking the messages on prevention, care and support to people living in small towns and villages across the country. The aim is also to create an environment, free from stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV, so they can access the services, without fear and prejudice, and live a life of dignity. It has proved to be a successful multi- sectoral initiative, of the NACO and a powerful advocacy tool, both at the state and district level, besides enhancing local capacity to deal with HIV prevention.
