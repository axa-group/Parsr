#### HOW CAN I VOICE MY OPINION?

At each ICANN meeting, anyone can make comments and ask questions on the main topics directly to the Board at the Public Forum. During the Public Forum, you may speak on behalf of your organization or as an individual.

The Public Forum usually lasts several hours on Thursday after- noon of every ICANN meeting. Commenters line up behind a microphone that is placed near the front of the room to ask a question or make a comment. Attendees are encouraged to be brief and concise to enable as many perspectives to be heard as possible. You don’t have to be physically present  
to participate – you can follow along online via ICANN’s Re- mote Participation services and submit questions or comments to be read out in the meeting room by a staff member.

You can also provide feedback through public comment periods. See page 4.

### What is ICANN?

ICANN is a not-for-profit, public-benefit organization formed in 1998. Its staff operates the Internet’s Domain Name System, coordinates allocation and assignment of the Internet’s unique identifiers, such as Internet Protocol addresses, accredits generic top-level domain (gTLD) name registrars, and helps facilitate the voices of volunteers worldwide who are dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. ICANN promotes competition in the domain name space and helps develop Internet policy.

### How is ICANN organized?

At the heart of ICANN’s policy-making is what is called a “multistakeholder model.” This decentralized governance model places individuals, industry, non-commercial interests and government on an equal level. Unlike more traditional, top-down governance models, where governments make policy deci-sions, the multistakeholder approach used by ICANN allows for community-based consensus-driven policy-making. The idea is that Internet governance should mimic the structure of the Internet itself- borderless and open to all.

While the ICANN Board of Directors has the ultimate authority to approve or reject policy recommenda- tions, Supporting Organizations (SOs) are responsible for developing and making policy recommenda- tions to the Board. Advisory Committees (ACs) advise the ICANN Board and, in certain cases, can raise issues for policy development. The SO/ACs are described in more detail later in this booklet.

ICANN staff is responsible for executing and implementing policies developed by the ICANN community and adopted by the ICANN Board.

The ICANN Ombudsman is an independent, impartial and neutral person contracted to ICANN, with ju- risdiction over problems and complaints made about decisions, actions or inactions by ICANN, the Board of Directors, or unfair treatment of a community member by ICANN staff, Board or a constituency body.

The Nominating Committee is a team of community volunteers responsible for the selection of eight ICANN Board members, and portions of the At-Large Advisory Committee, the Country Code Names Supporting Organization and the Generic Names Supporting Organization.

ICANN Multistakeholder Model

### What Happens at an ICANN Meeting?

ICANN holds three international public meetings each calendar year in different regions of the globe. One meeting each year is also the organization’s annual general meeting, during which new Board members take their seats.

Usually comprised of more than 200 different sessions, the week-long meeting is a focal point for individuals and representatives of the different ICANN stakeholders (either attending in-person or participating remotely) to introduce and discuss issues related to ICANN policy. In most cases anyone may speak, but in a few cases you may need to be a member of a particular group. If you are uncertain of the rules during a session, simply ask the session leader if you may speak.

Meetings are open to everyone and registration is free, but you are responsible for your own travel and lodging. ICANN offers limited financial assistance to members of its Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees. Also, there is a Fellowship program for selected candidates from developing countries who otherwise could not afford to attend in-person.

If you cannot physically attend a meeting, ICANN offers a variety of services to ensure that the power of participation is just a click away. Virtual meeting rooms are available for nearly all sessions with access to meeting materials, a chat room and for larger or general sessions, video and/or audio streaming and live transcription.

Learn more at [http://meetings.icann.org/remote-participation.](http://meetings.icann.org/remote-participation.)

Though English is the main language at ICANN meetings, translation, scribing and interpretation are available at certain sessions. Many documents are made available in Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish.

Each meeting has a dedicated web site with a frequently updated meeting schedule, venue map, information on the local area and social events.

### Newcomers’ Program at ICANN Meetings

ICANN welcomes Newcomers into its multistakeholder process through a special orientation program during its meetings. First launched at ICANN 40 in March 2011, the Newcomers’ Program is a starting point for understanding ICANN and its community, what it does and how the system works. It also helps Newcomers engage with the ICANN community and participate effectively so that they leave the meeting well informed and willing to come back.

``` Greeters at the Newcomers Lounge at ICANN meetings are ready to answer questions and introduce newcomers and Fellows to more seasoned community members. ```

---

#### Newcomers' Sunday Track

On the Sunday before the meeting begins, ICANN holds a series of training sessions – usually between 10:00 and 18:00 – just for Newcomers. Among the topics covered are an introduction to ICANN, how to use ICANN engagement tools, how the community interacts during and in between meetings, and much more. Participation and Engagement staff coordinate these sessions, and various ICANN staff conduct them, depending on the expertise subject matter.

#### Newcomers' Lounge

First-time attendees can relax, get information and interact with staff and Fellowship Program alumni volunteers at the Newcomers’ Lounge. Helping to alleviate any first-time meeting anxiety, these mentors provide hands-on support, guidance and introductions to community members, the ICANN structure and process, and advice on sessions of interest. The Lounge is open from Saturday to Wednesday dur- ing ICANN meetings.

### Public Comment Periods at ICANN

A vital element in ICANN's processes is the opportunity for public comment on each substantial piece of work before it is considered for approval. These topics can be operational (such as budget or stra- tegic planning), technical (such as security reports and recommendations) or policy-oriented (such as Bylaw changes).

The following principles guide the public comment process: 

**Each session offers remote participation options for either low- or high-bandwidth users.**

- Each item posted for public comment is available for a minimum of 21 days.


- If comments are received, then at the close of the comment period, a reply period begins, lasting a minimum of 21 days.

- If no substantive comments are received during the comment period, then there will be no reply period.

- During the reply period, participants should address previous comments submitted; new posts concerning the topic should not be introduced. When constructing replies, contributors are asked to cite the original poster’s name, comment date, and any particular text that is pertinent.

You can find a list of all topics open for public comment on a dedicated public comment page ([http://www.icann.org/en/news/public-comment](http://www.icann.org/en/news/public-comment)). The page includes links to relevant announcements, docu- ments, comment locations, and reference sources with full descriptions and background information.

After the comment period is closed, staff publishes a comment summary report that is archived along with all public comment documentation and comments received.

``` The Fellowship Program provides grants to members of the global Internet community who would otherwise be unable to attend. Fellows come from ccTLDs, governments, civil society, the business community and academia. Learn more at [http://www.icann.org/en/about/](http://www.icann.org/en/about/) participate/fellowships. ```

### ICANN Board of Directors

An internationally diverse Board of Directors oversees the policy development process and ICANN governance. The Board has 16 voting members and five non-voting liaison representatives. ICANN’s President serves as an ex oficio, voting member of the Board.  
The Address Supporting Organization (ASO), the Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO) and the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) each select two voting members of the Board. The At-Large Advisory Committee (ALAC) in conjunction with the Regional At-Large Organizations (RALOS) selects one voting member. A Nominating Committee selects the remaining eight voting members. Non-voting liaisons to the Board provide technical advice to inform Board decision-making. ICANN’s Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC) and Security & Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) each appoint a Board liaison. ICANN’s Technical Liaison Group appoints a liaison to the Board, as does the Internet Engineering Task Force, which is an international and decentralized organization that develops and designs standards for the Internet system.

## SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS

ICANN has three Supporting Organizations that develop and recommend policies concerning the Internet’s technical management within their areas of expertise.  
They are the Address Supporting Organization (ASO), the Country Code Names Supporting Organiza- tion (ccNSO) and the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO).

### Address Supporting Organization

##### What is the Address Supporting Organization?

An advisory body to the ICANN Board on global policy issues relating to the operation, allocation and management of Internet Protocol addresses, the Address Supporting Organization (ASO) is comprised of representatives of five autonomous Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). These RIRs manage regional distribution of Internet number resources including IP address and Autonomous System Numbers. Each RIR is a member of the Number Resource Organization, which coordinates their activities globally. 

#### The five RIRs are:

- African Network Information Center (AfriNIC), covering the African continent
- Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC), covering the Asia-Pacific region including Japan, Korea, China, and Australia
- American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), covering Canada, some Caribbean and North Atlantic islands and the United States
- Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Regis-try (LACNIC), covering Latin America and Caribbean
- Réseaux IP Européens (RIPE NCC), covering Europe, the Middle East and parts of Asia 


#### What is the ASO Address Council?

The Address Council is made up of the Address Supporting Organization and its purpose is to oversee recommendations to the ICANN Board of Directors on Internet Protocol address policy and to manage the global policy development activities. The Address Council is also responsible for appointing two voting members to the ICANN Board.  

#### How is the ASO Address Council chosen?  
Address Council members are appointed through separate nominations and election processes in each of the Regional Internet Registry regions. Each of the five Regional Internet Registries appoints three members of the ASO Address Council for two-year terms. The Council elects a chair who appoints vice-chairs.  

### How can I get involved in the ASO? 
Most individuals get involved in the ASO through affiliation with a Regional Internet Registry. If your organization receives a direct allocation or holds a direct assignment of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses from a registry, you are likely already a member of that RIR. (Generally speaking, these are Internet Providers, hosting firms, educational institutions or governments.)

``` 
The ccNSO provides a forum for country code top-level domain managers to meet and discuss issues of concern from a global perspective.
```

However, the RIRs have no membership requirements to participate in their policy development pro- cesses or attend their meetings. Anyone in the Internet community is welcome to participate in the development of Internet resource allocation polices for that region.

### Country Code Names Supporting Organization

#### What is the Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO)?

The ccNSO is a Supporting Organization responsible for developing and recommending to ICANN’s Board global policies relating to country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). It also provides a platform to the ccTLD community to develop best practices, exchange information and discuss global issues relevant for ccTLDs. A ccTLD is a two-letter domain name extension corresponding to a country, territory or other geographic location, such as .uk (United Kingdom), .de (Germany) and .jp (Japan).  

#### *What is the ccNSO Council?  

The ccNSO Council administers and coordinates the affairs of the ccNSO and manages the development of policy recommendations. They lead and participate in various ccNSO Working Groups and engage the community in topical issues. The Council formally selects two members to the ICANN Board, after being elected by the ccNSO Members.  

#### How is the ccNSO Council chosen?* 
The ccNSO Council has 18 members serving staggered three-year terms. ccNSO members elect 15 Councilors, three from each of the five geographic regions. ccNSO members may self-nominate or be nominated by another ccNSO member from their region; nominations must be seconded by another ccNSO member from the region. ICANN’s Nominating Committee fills the remaining three seats.

#### How can I get involved in the ccNSO?
 
If you are the manager of an International Standards Organization 3166 (ISO 3166) country code top-level domain, you are welcome to become a member of the ccNSO or to participate in any of its Working Groups and attend any of its meetings. The application to join is at [http://ccnso.icann.org/applications/](http://ccnso.icann.org/applications/) form.htm. There is no membership fee.

``` 
The Generic Names Supporting Organization Council at ICANN’s 44th Public Meeting in Prague. 
```

### Generic Names Supporting Organization

##### What is the Generic Names Supporting Organization?

The Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) is the policy-making body responsible for ge- neric top-level domains, such as .COM, .NET and .ORG. Its members include representatives from gTLD registries, gTLD registrars, intellectual property interests, Internet service providers, businesses and non-commercial interests.

###### What are Stakeholder Groups within the GNSO?

Stakeholder Groups function as caucuses, and are intended to facilitate the creation of the new con- stituencies as well as growth and expansion of GNSO participants. There are four Stakeholder Groups representing the wide variety of groups and individuals interested in generic top-level domain policy development. They are:

- Commercial Stakeholder Group
- Non-commercial Stakeholder Group
- Registrar Stakeholder Group
- gTLD Registries Stakeholder Group

##### What is the GNSO Council?

The 23 members of the Council govern policy development in the GNSO, make policy recommenda- tions to the ICANN Board and appoint two members to the ICANN Board.

##### How are the members of the GNSO Council chosen?

Stakeholder Groups appoint 18 of the GNSO Council’s 23 members. For voting purposes, the Council has two houses, like the US Congress or the British Parliament. The Contracted Parties House holds the Registries and Registrars Stakeholder Groups, while the Non-Contracted Parties House holds the Commercial and Non-Commercial Stakeholder Groups. ICANN’s Nominating Committee appoints three Council members, two of which are voting members assigned to each House. The third appointee is an advisor to the Council as a whole. The Council also includes formally appointed but non-voting Liaisons and Observers from other groups, such as the At-Large Community and the ccNSO, within ICANN. This elaborate system provides checks and balances so no single interest group can dominate the Council.

---

#### How can I get involved in the GNSO?

GNSO-chartered Working Groups are formally chartered within the ICANN Structure to address policies and other issues facing the Internet community and its stakeholders. In general, anyone can join these groups and they are typically made up of volunteers with various interests and expertise. One of many tools used by Working Groups are mailing lists that are publicly archived. Community members can follow email lists for the latest dialogue and deliberation of policy topics and activity.  
Monitor the ICANN.ORG home page for announcements about calls for volunteers to Working Groups, and when you see one you are interested in, send the GNSO Secretariat an email expressing your interest. You’ll be asked to draft a Statement of Interest so that other group members can learn more about you. And they’ll be asked to do the same. Working groups usually meet via weekly or bi-weekly conference calls, but each one establishes the best schedule for the group.  
You may also apply for membership in one of the GNSO’s Stakeholder Groups or Constituencies. Stake- holder Groups and Constituencies are groups of community participants united around a particular common interest or perspective, formally recognized by the ICANN Board. Each Stakeholder Group and Constituency has its own unique eligibility rules. Also, membership fees may be required to join a Stakeholder Group or Constituency. For more information about specific membership requirements and joining, visit the web sites listed below.

## ADVISORY COMMITTEES

ICANN has four Advisory Committees that serve as formal advisory bodies to the ICANN Board. They are made up of representatives from the Internet community to advise on a particular issue or policy area. ICANN Bylaws mandate four: At-Large Advisory Committee, DNS Root Server System Advisory Committee, Governmental Advisory Committee, and Security and Stability Advisory Committee.

### At-Large Advisory Committee

##### What is the At-Large Advisory Committee?

The At-Large Advisory Committee (ALAC) is the primary organizational home for the voice and con- cerns of the individual Internet user in ICANN processes. Its role is to consider and provide advice on the activities of ICANN insofar as they relate to the interests of individual Internet users. This includes policies created through ICANN’s Supporting Organizations, as well as the many other issues for which community input and advice is appropriate. The ALAC and At-Large Community selects one member of the ICANN Board of Directors.  
ALAC is a subset of the “At-Large Community” which has a ground-up, tiered structure. At the grassroots level are nearly 150 At-Large Structures (ALSes). These local organizations of At-Large members are located throughout the world. The ALSes are organized by region through five Regional At-Large Or- ganizations, or RALOs. The RALOs are the main forum and coordination point for their part of the world.

```
 Joining a constituency or a stakeholder group is the most common way to get involved in the GNSO.
```

---

#### Following are the five RALOs:


- African Regional At-Large Organization (AFRALO) [http://www.atlarge.icann.org/afralo/](http://www.atlarge.icann.org/afralo/)

- Asia Pacific Regional At-Large Organization (APRALO) [http://www.atlarge.icann.org/apralo/](http://www.atlarge.icann.org/apralo/)

- European At-Large Organization (EURALO) [http://www.atlarge.icann.org/euralo/](http://www.atlarge.icann.org/euralo/)

- Latin American and Caribbean Islands Regional At-Large Organization (LACRALO) [http://www.atlarge.icann.org/lacralo/](http://www.atlarge.icann.org/lacralo/)

- North American Regional At-Large Organization (NARALO) [http://www.atlarge.icann.org/naralo/](http://www.atlarge.icann.org/naralo/)

ICANN At-Large Organization Diagram




*2012 marked the ten-year anniversary of the At-Large Advisory Committee in its current form. The ALAC was created to provide a way for active individual users of the Internet from around the world to participate in ICANN.*

---

#### How are the members of ALAC chosen?

The 15-member ALAC consists of two members selected by each of the Regional At-Large Organiza- tions for a total of ten directly appointed representatives, and five members selected by the Nominating Committee. The five members selected by the Nominating Committee shall include one citizen of a country within each of the five Geographic Regions.  

#### How can I get involved with ALAC?

An individual Internet user typically joins At-Large by joining one of its local ALSes, and then through the ALS becomes involved in their RALO.  

However, an individual Internet user may also be able to join a RALO directly. The RALOs are tasked with keeping the Internet user community in their region informed about ICANN’s activities through public outreach and distribution of information and knowledge. Each RALO is autonomous, governed by its own organizing documents. While each RALO elects a chair and secretariat, and in some cases a vice president, they have their own requirements for the positions. 

Since all At-Large meetings are open, individual members may participate in At-Large community meetings, or the conference calls of ALAC, RALOs, subcommittees and Working Groups.  


#### How does ALAC get involved in ICANN’s policy-making process?

In cases in which the ALAC has determined that an emerging ICANN policy is of significant importance to individual Internet users, it gets involved early in the policy development process, often enlisting At-Large members to directly participate in the Working Group developing the policy. ALAC may also submit a Public Comment describing its position.  

There are Working Groups within the At-Large Community, as well as WGs that consist of members from different Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees. The ALAC has established a number of standing WGs and subcommittees to work on ongoing or long-term issues. Learn more at [https://community.icann.org/display/atlarge/At-Large+Working+Groups](https://community.icann.org/display/atlarge/At-Large+Working+Groups).

#### How can I find more information about ALAC and the At-Large Community?
  
The At-Large home page at www.atlarge.icann.org is the main starting point for news and reference documents about the At-Large Community. The At-Large community wiki page is also an excellent source of information on At-Large activities (see: [https://community.icann.org/display/atlarge/At-Large+Advisory+Committee+%28ALAC%29](https://community.icann.org/display/atlarge/At-Large+Advisory+Committee+%28ALAC%29) ).  

### Governmental Advisory Committee
 
#### What is the Governmental Advisory Committee?  
The Governmental Advisory Committee is comprised of appointed representatives of national govern- ments, multi-national governmental organizations and treaty organizations, and distinct economies. 

#### How does the GAC participate in the ICANN policy-making process?

The GAC’s key role is to provide advice to ICANN on issues of public policy, especially where there may be an interaction between ICANN’s activities or policies and national laws or international agreements. ICANN duly takes into account the GAC’s advice on public policy matters, both in the formulation and adoption of policies.  

The GAC usually meets three times a year in conjunction with ICANN meetings, where it discusses issues with the ICANN Board and other ICANN Supporting Organizations, Advisory Committees and other groups.

#### How can I get involved with the GAC?

According to its operating principles, “national governments or distinct economies as recognized in international fora” may be GAC members.  

Governments and others interested in joining the GAC as a member or observer can send a formal enquiry to the GAC Secretariat.

```
GAC meetings are typically attended by approximately 50 national governments, distinct economies, and global organizations such as the ITU, UNESCO, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), INTERPOL and regional organizations such as the OECD, Asia Pacific Forum, and Council of Europe.
```

---

#### How is an individual chosen to participate in the GAC on behalf of a member or observer organization?

Each GAC member or observer may appoint one representative and one alternate to the GAC. Advisors may accompany the accredited representative. The accredited representative, alternate and advisors must hold a formal official position with the GAC member’s public administration. GAC members elect a chair who serves as a non-voting liaison to the ICANN Board.

##### How does the GAC make decisions?

The GAC works on the basis of seeking consensus among its membership. Consistent with United Nations practice, consensus is understood to mean the practice of adopting decisions by general agreement in the absence of any formal objection. Where consensus is not possible, the Chair shall convey the full range of views expressed by members to the ICANN Board.

#### Where can I find more information about the GAC?

The GAC has a web site where it posts general information, meeting materials, presentations and vari- ous types of papers distributed at its meetings. In addition, at the end of every ICANN Public Meeting where the GAC meets, the GAC issues a formal communiqué that provides comment on the issues it discussed. Transcripts of open sessions are released a few weeks after the meetings.

### Root Server System Advisory Committee

#### What is the Root Server System Advisory Committee?

The RSSAC is an advisory committee to the ICANN Board about the operation of the root name servers of the Domain Name System, including the operational requirements of root name servers, such as host hardware capacities, operating systems and name server software versions, network connectivity and physical environment.

#### How are members of the RSSAC chosen?

RSSAC members are representatives of organizations responsible for operating the world’s thirteen root name servers and other organizations concerned with stable technical operation of the authoritative root server system.

#### How does RSSAC get involved in ICANN’s policy-making process?

RSSAC responds to requests from ICANN’s Board of Directors for advice on technical issues. They de- velop consensus-based advice on issues such as the deployment of internationalized domain names in the root zone.

#### How can I get involved in RSSAC?

The RSSAC typically holds its meetings during those of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) rather than during ICANN meetings. These often occur a few weeks after an ICANN meeting in a different location.

#### Where can I find more information about RSSAC?

RSSAC advice and other information can be found at [http://www.icann.org/en/groups/rssac](http://www.icann.org/en/groups/rssac).

### Security and Stability Advisory Committee

Its activities relate to the security and integrity of the Internet’s naming and address allocation systems.

#### How are members of the SSAC chosen?

The ICANN Board appoints the chair and members of SSAC. The SSAC Membership Committee meets with potential candidates and reviews their experience, interest, and skills before making recommenda- tions for membership to the SSAC. If the SSAC agrees to admit new members based on those recom- mendations it then requests Board appointments via the SSAC Liaison to the Board.

---

#### How does the SSAC get involved in ICANN’s policy-making process?

The SSAC produces written advice, reports, and comments on a range of matters relating to the correct and reliable operation of the root name system, to address allocation and Internet number assignment, and to registry and registrar services. The SSAC also tracks and assesses threats and risks to the Internet naming and address allocation services.

#### How can I get involved in the SSAC?

Interested individuals are invited to contact the Director of SSAC Support, the Chair or any SSAC member about joining the SSAC. Candidates will be asked to submit a resume or curriculum vitae, a statement of interest and a description of the skills they would bring to the committee.

#### Where can I find more information about SSAC?

The SSAC web pages on ICANN.ORG include more information on operating procedures, members, and a list of Reports, Advisories and Comments at [http://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac]([http://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac]).

### ICANN Staff

#### What is the role of ICANN’s staff?

### Ombudsman

#### What is the Ombudsman?

The ICANN Ombudsman is an independent, impartial and neutral person contracted to ICANN, with jurisdiction over problems and complaints about decisions, actions or delay by ICANN and the sup- porting bodies, as described in this Guide. He is an advocate for fairness.

#### What the Ombudsman does

The Ombudsman investigates complaints and attempts to resolve them. Emphasizing mediation as a means for resolving issues, he will often convene a mediation between parties. You can learn more about what he does at his web page at [http://www.icann.org/en/help/ombudsman/contact](http://www.icann.org/en/help/ombudsman/contact).


The Ombudsman’s office door is always open for a discussion about any problem. Even if he does not have the power to investigate, he will often be able to find the appropriate place to seek help.

#### Powers of the Ombudsman

The Ombudsman does not have the power to make, change or set aside a policy, administrative or Board decision, act, or omission. The Ombudsman does have the power to investigate these events, and to use dispute resolution techniques like mediation to resolve them.

#### How do I contact the Ombudsman?

Drop by the Ombudsman Office during an ICANN public meeting to speak face-to-face, send an email to ombudsman@icann.org or fill out an online complaint form at [http://ombudsman.icann.org/ complaints/](http://ombudsman.icann.org/complaints/).

## ONE WORLD. ONE INTERNET.

### About ICANN

ICANN’s mission is to ensure a stable and unified global Internet.

To reach another person on the Internet you have to type an address into your computer—a name or a number. That address has to be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN coordinates these unique identifiers across the world. Without that coordination we wouldn’t have one global Internet.

ICANN was formed in 1998. It is a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation with participants from around the world dedicated to keep- ing the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It promotes competition and develops policy on the Internet’s unique identifiers.

ICANN doesn’t control content on the Internet. It cannot stop spam and it doesn’t deal with access to the Internet. But through its coordination role of the Internet’s naming system, it does have an important impact on the expansion and evolution of the Internet. For more information please visit www.icann.org.
