##1 Introduction

Between June 1985 and January 1987, a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine, called the Therac-25, massively overdosed six people. These accidents have been described as the worst in the 35 year history of medical accelerators [6].
A detailed accident investigation, drawn from publicly available documents, can be found in Leveson and Turner [4]. The following account is taken from this report and includes both the factors involved in the overdoses themselves and the attempts by the users, manufacturers, and governments to deal with them. Because this accident was never officially investigated, some information on the Therac-25 software development, management, and quelity control procedures are not available. What is included below has been gleaned from law suits and depositions, government records, and copies of correspondence and other material obtained from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates this devices.

##2 Background

Medical linear accelerators (linacs) accelerate electrons to create high-energy beams that can destroy tumors with minimal impact on the surrounding
